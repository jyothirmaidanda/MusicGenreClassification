# 🎵 Music Genre Classification
This project focuses on classifying music genres using machine learning models trained on audio feature datasets. It involves preprocessing audio data, feature extraction, and building classification models to accurately predict the genre of a given music clip.

📌 Key Features
Extracts meaningful features from audio files (e.g., MFCCs, chroma, spectral contrast)
Implements machine learning models like Random Forest, SVM, and KNN for genre prediction
Visualizes dataset insights and model performance using plots and confusion matrices
Interactive playback of audio samples within Jupyter Notebooks
Clean modular code with reproducible results

🧠 Technologies Used
Python
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
librosa for audio feature extraction
scikit-learn for model building and evaluation
Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization

📁 Dataset
The project uses the GTZAN Genre Collection, a commonly used benchmark dataset containing 10 genres with 100 audio files each.
